# LevelUp Habit Tracker Project Context - Updated

## Project Summary

LevelUp is a gamified habit tracking application built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It allows users to create and track habits, earn XP, level up, and achieve milestones. The backend is fully developed with comprehensive API endpoints and testing. Frontend development has made significant progress, with core functionalities implemented and user experience improvements ongoing.

## Current Focus

Implementing friend system integration and enhancing the feed system with friend data.

## Recent Achievements

1. Implemented one-click habit tracking on the Today page.
2. Redesigned habit cards for better user experience.
3. Implemented edit and archive mode toggles in the top navigation bar.
4. Created an Archive page with reactivation functionality.
5. Updated the Add Habit page to use habit templates.
6. Implemented proper context management for edit and archive modes.

## Current State

1. The application supports creating, editing, tracking, and archiving daily habits.
2. User profile and settings pages are functional.
3. XP and level thresholds are configured and operational.
4. Achievement system is functional and integrated with the feed.
5. Basic feed page structure is in place with actual data fetching and display.
6. Tip system is operational and integrated into the feed.
7. One-click tracking, archiving, and reactivation of habits are fully functional.

## Next Steps (in order of priority)

1. Friend System Integration (High Priority):
   - Update User model to include friends array
   - Create API endpoint for searching users
   - Implement backend route for adding friends
   - Create "Add Friend" page or modal in frontend
   - Display friends on user profile
   - Create basic friend profile view
   - Update feed to show friend activities

2. Privacy Settings Implementation (Medium Priority):
   - Add privacy toggles to habit creation/edit form
   - Create settings page for user profile privacy
   - Update backend to respect privacy settings

3. Feed System Optimization (Medium Priority):
   - Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for the feed
   - Optimize feed loading for users with many achievements and friend activities

4. Client-Side Time Checks (Low Priority):
   - Ensure correct habit tracking and streak counting
   - Implement checks for new day and data refreshing

5. Local Storage Implementation (Low Priority):
   - Add local storage for offline functionality
   - Ensure synchronization with the database

6. PWA Enhancements (Low Priority):
   - Ensure manifest file and icons are in place
   - Implement basic service worker for caching static assets

## Implementation Plan

1. Friend System Integration:
   - Update User.js model to include friends array
   - Create new API endpoint in user.js controller for searching users
   - Implement new route in user.js router for adding friends
   - Create AddFriend.tsx component for frontend
   - Update Profile.tsx to display friend list
   - Create FriendProfile.tsx component
   - Modify Feed.tsx and related hooks to include friend activities

2. Privacy Settings Implementation:
   - Update Habit.js model to include privacy field
   - Modify habit.js controller to handle privacy settings
   - Update EditHabit.tsx to include privacy toggle
   - Create PrivacySettings.tsx component for user profile privacy
   - Update relevant backend routes to respect privacy settings

3. Feed System Optimization:
   - Implement pagination in feed.js controller
   - Update useFeed.ts hook to support paginated data fetching
   - Modify Feed.tsx to implement infinite scrolling or "Load More" functionality

## Questions to Consider

1. How should we handle friend requests? Immediate addition or request-accept flow?
2. What's the best way to display friend activities in the feed while respecting privacy settings?
3. How can we optimize the friend search functionality for a large user base?
4. What level of granularity should we implement for privacy settings (e.g., per habit, per achievement, or global)?

## Additional Notes

- Prioritize the friend system integration for the upcoming presentation.
- Focus on creating a smooth and intuitive user experience for adding and interacting with friends.
- Ensure proper error handling and user feedback throughout the friend system implementation.
- Keep in mind the time constraints and prioritize features that can be demonstrated effectively in the presentation.

This updated context reflects the current state of the LevelUp Habit Tracker project and outlines the prioritized tasks for implementing the friend system and enhancing the overall user experience. The focus is on completing these core features while maintaining a cohesive and engaging user interface, with an emphasis on preparing for the upcoming presentation.
